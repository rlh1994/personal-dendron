Projects are a high level collection of resources and services e.g. virtual machines and databases. It also contains settings, permissions, and security rules including specific [[IAM roles|gcp.IAM]] which apply across the project.

Each project has a **Project ID**, and **Project Name** and a **Project Number**. In many cases large companies and cloud developers may have large numbers of projects to enable good separation of resources and billing.
