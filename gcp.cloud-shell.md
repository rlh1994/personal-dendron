> Cloud Shell is a virtual machine that is loaded with development tools. It offers a persistent 5GB home directory and runs on the Google Cloud. Cloud Shell provides command-line access to your Google Cloud resources.

Once connected and authenticated (automatically) the project in the shell is set to your project id. You can find a full list of commands [here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud).

## Home Directory
 The contents of your Cloud Shell Home directory persist across projects between all Cloud Shell sessions, even after the virtual machine is terminated and restarted.
