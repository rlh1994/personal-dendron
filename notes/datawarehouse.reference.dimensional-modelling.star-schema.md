## Definition
Star schemas are a type of logical data design that builds your data using [[Fact|datawarehouse.reference.dimensional-modelling.fact-table]] and Dimension tables. 

Star schemas do _not_ have to physically be how your data ends up to users, and often is not, but instead are a tool to help think more clearly about the split of your data and how this needs to be sourced, udpated, and organised.
