Dashboards are a great way in JIRA to combine multiple views and analysis about your tickets in one single place. A user can have multiple dashboards which means each one can have a specific purpose and allow focused context.

A dashboard is composed of *gadgets* which will offer a variety of outputs and uses, and many more are available to be downloaded and added to JIRA. Some common gadgets that are used include `Filter Results` which shows the results of a specific [[filter|tools.jira.filters]] and displays selected columns, or Average Age Chart to understand the age of tickets in your workstack. Gadgets can do aggregations, plot charts, link to tickets, and much more!

Similar to [[tools.jira.filters]] you can share a dashboard with users and groups for viewing or design collaboration.
