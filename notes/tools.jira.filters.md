JIRA filters are based on queries written in [[tools.jira.jql]] that can be saved and used within a variety of other JIRA features including [[tools.jira.dashboards]] gadgets, Plans, or Boards to ensure only the relevant tickets are displayed.

Filters can be set to have a standard set of columns displayed on them whenever the filter is viewed (and can vary per-filter), and they can also be subscribed to any a custom schedule to receive an e-mail with all matching tickets linked in the e-mail.

Filters can be shared with groups or individual users for them to be able to use the same filter (which is great for teams!) or editors so that multiple people can manage the definition of the filter.
