Below is a list of extensions that I find useful and want to make others aware of. I have excluded many language specific extensions such as html preview, or pylance, as these you would come across working in those areas regardless. I have also excluded theme specific extensions as these are always personal choice.

## Core
#### Dendron
**id:** [dendron.dendron](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dendron.dendron)
