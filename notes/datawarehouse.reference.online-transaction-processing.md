## Definition

OnLine Transaction Processing (OLTP) are types of systems used within business to **support** the execution of business processes. They are designed to be efficient in updates and consistent in writes to ensure quick and stable business running. 

They are expected to have predictable inputs, update in real time, but have a low volume of rows per transaction. The data tends to be more _raw_ that processed, and there are few table joins per transation.

An [[entity relationship diagram (ERD)|datawarehouse.reference.entity-relationship-diagram]] is often used to design an operational system and the data is often in a [[normalised|datawarehouse.reference.normal-forms]] structure.
